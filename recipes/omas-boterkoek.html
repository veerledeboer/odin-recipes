    <h2>How to make this mouthwatering Dutch Butter Cake</h2>
    <p>My grandmother is a very strong human being. Never have I ever met a more vital and energetic woman of 95. I look up to her. She has been taking care of my grandfather with a lot of love, but also has always taken care of the rest of the family. Always wanting to give, and food is her love language, or better... Butter Cake is her love language. For me, she's called Oma Boterkoek. When I was little and we went to my grandparents or we would see them, she would always bring a butter cake. First I didn't really enjoy it, but now... Damn that stuff is golden. So here now, the very secret!!!! recipe of my grandmothers Butter Cake. </p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250 grams of flour, sieved</li>
        <li>230 grams white caster sugar, sieved
        </li>
        <li>1 pinch of salt
        </li>
        <li>225 grams of cold butter in pieces
        </li>
        <li>1 egg white
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to make this</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Knead the ingredients into a mass. Make a few holes in it with your thumb, divide half of the protein over it and knead it through. Let the ball rest for at least an hour.
        </li>
        <li>Then put them in a metal butter cake mold (with serrated edge and a diameter of 24 cm) and flatten into a round cake that comes to about Â½ cm from the edges. Stroke the rest of the eggwhite on the dough. 
        </li>
        <li>In the middle of a non preheated oven on a rack and bake at 185 degrees for about 30 minutes. Then, when the top is golden brown, in the tin, remove from the oven and cover to cool. Cutting the mold into diamond-shaped pieces is the most convenient.
        </li>
    </ol>
